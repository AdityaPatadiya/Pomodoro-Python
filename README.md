# Pomodoro Timer


## Description:

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer implemented using Python's tkinter module. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals separated by short breaks. This timer helps users stay focused during work sessions and take regular breaks.

## Features:

* Work Sessions: Set for 25 minutes by default, the timer counts down work sessions followed by short breaks. After every 4 work sessions, a longer break is scheduled.
* Customizable: Users can adjust work session, short break, and long break durations as needed.
* Countdown Display: Visual representation of time remaining in minutes and seconds.
* Start and Reset: Buttons to start the timer and reset it to its initial state.
* Check Marks: Keeps track of completed work sessions with check marks.

## How to Use:

1. Set the duration for work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks (default: 25 minutes work, 5 minutes short break, 20 minutes long break).
2. Click "Start" to begin the timer.
3. After each work session, take a short break. After every 4 work sessions, take a longer break.
4. Click "Reset" to reset the timer.

## Dependencies:

This timer requires Python 3 and the tkinter module.
